The application provides many endpoints, but you should start with retrieving coordinates for city.
- `http://localhost:8080/city-weather-app/localization/city?country-code=PL&city=Kalisz` - retrieves coordinates for given country-code and city like this:
```json
{
    "countryCode": "PL",
    "name": "Pozna≈Ñ",
    "latitude": "52.40692",
    "longitude": "16.92993"
}
```
then you can for example check the current weather for given localization
- `http://localhost:8080/city-weather-app/weather?latitude=52.40692&longitude=16.92993` - retrieves current weather for given coordinates like this:
```json
{
    "symbol": "n400",
    "symbolPhrase": "overcast",
    "temperature": 14,
    "feelsLikeTemp": 14,
    "dewPoint": 8,
    "windSpeed": 9,
    "uvIndex": 0,
    "pressure": 1013.29,
    "visibility": 10000
}
```
